### ðŸ”¹ Weekly Summary (Will add some things daily, to be summarized and formalized at the ed of the week)
**Main insights:**  
21/10/25
- Probablistic and deterministic systems. 
- Algebraic view of cyphers as those that consist of transformations. 
- Pure ciphers with identifiable M and E systems, mainly working as transformations.
- Pure ciphers as groups.

24/10/24
- Residue classes for pure systems. Only for systems that leak structure given the ciphertext. 
- Pure systems are classified as ones that contain groups within each residue class. 
- Difference between purity (Shannon's classification of probabilities having seen the cipher) and perfect secrecy (not leaking text). 
- Similarly it can be shown that the a posteriori probabilities of the different keys are the same
in value but these values are associated with different keys when a different
key is used. The same set of values of P_E(K)  have undergone a permutation
among the keys. 
- I still don't get what the above means. Will review that the next time.
